# ready.js

equivalent to $.ready

If you know [jQuery.ready](https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/), then you know what this is.

```js
ready(function() {
    console.log( "document is ready!" );
});
```

## NOTE

There has already a Ready equivalent by [youmightnotneedjquery.com](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/), but not work on IE8 as expected by my test.
